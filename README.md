# Banana Classification Project

Welcome to the Banana Classification project! This project aims to classify images of bananas into two categories: fresh and rotten.

## Dataset

In the `dataset` folder, you will find a meticulously curated collection of images featuring both fresh and rotten bananas. The dataset is conveniently organized into `test` and `train` folders, allowing for seamless model training and evaluation. For your convenience, the final test set is located in the `Final test` folder, ready for testing the trained model.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get started with the Banana Classification project:

1. **Download the Dataset:**
   - Locate the `dataset.zip` file in the root folder.
   - Unzip the file to in the root directory.

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open the `banana_classifier.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the cells to train and evaluate the model.

Feel free to customize and extend this project according to your preferences. Whether you're interested in enhancing the model's accuracy or adding more fruit varieties, the possibilities are endless. Happy coding and may your bananas always be fresh! üçå‚ú®
